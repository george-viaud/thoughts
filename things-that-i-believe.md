### Life
* Life is about three things: Storytelling, Contrast, and making decisions easy for other people
* No one knows anything, we're all feeling around in the dark
* It's important to be flexible with beliefs, that my beliefs and opinions may change with the facts.
* Humor comes from differences and timing
* A man should have a mystery about him, how he does all that he does
* Take information, synthesize it for yourself and then form your opinion
* There are no rules
* I'm only racing me
* College is about transporting information from the first day to the last. You don't have to learn anything other than how to play the game effectively. Also, take that time to mature.
* The best things in life almost don't happen.


### The Universe
* There are an infinite number of parallel universes, connected by black holes which at their bottoms produce big bangs
* Surround yourself with physical books
* I believe in God, I'm just not sure what to do with that belief yet
* Mathematically, there have to be other life forms out there, somewhere
* There's something magical about the ocean; it's also the perfect metaphor for anything you're going through


### Relationships
* People are people, we're all going through the same things. You have nothing to lose by reaching out
* Fidelity is of the utmost importance
* Marriage should be extended to everyone


### Self
* Always trust your gut
* "What you're thinking about you are becoming" - Muhammad Ali
* Everything is linked to exercise: eating, sleeping, discipline
* Do the next one.
* I hope I'm always this good at falling asleep


### Making
* A man should build things with his hands
* The details are the product
* Teams and communities produce more than the sum of their 
* Everything is built in a million little steps, do as many steps well as you can per day
